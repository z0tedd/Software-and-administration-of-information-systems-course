MY DREAMS FOR THE FUTURE
Hello everyone, you all know my name and my age. At the moment, I'm in my first year at STEM university,
and often dream about my future. have grand plans, and i'd like to tell you a bit about them.
My most immediate plans are plans for summer.
Before summer i need to go through pre-defense for my project in Samsung on the 30 may.
Later on the 5 june i am going to the trafic police exam, then i will suffer at exams in the university.
At the summer holidays i will suffer. Just suffer, maybe i wil get job in an office and suffer in it 
or maybe i will be suffering at the home. I will't get a rest, because rest must be earned, maybe
I will visit my brother. If we will visit him, then we will spent minimum 2 weeks with him, i am not quite excited,
but it's good opportunity to lose some weight(I will be a slave all these days & it's hard)
When I return I need to suffer at the uni. It's difficult, i will need to find a job to move away from my parents.
I am grateful to them for food and shelter, but i want to live alone.
I'd like to work as a programmer,but I won't refuse devops offer.
In next year i must become good programmer and find some job.
In five years' time, I would like to have my own business or a huge pile of money or flat in the Moscow. Perhaps I'll use 
slave power(hire students and pay them pennies) to achieve it.
Of course, one day t hope to marry and have children. Ideally before I'm 30, but I can't plan when I'll meet the right person, 
and haven't got a girlfriend at the moment.
In my dreams, I see myself 40 munning a successful company with about 100 employees. 
I'll take over the world. I'll have a beaut√≠ful house, a secret organization, a combat robot, and a bunch of implants inside of me.
