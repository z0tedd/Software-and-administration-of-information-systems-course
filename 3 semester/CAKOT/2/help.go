var TestString = `Ever on and on, I continue circling
With nothing but my hate and the carousel of agony
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
And suddenly I see that I can't break free, I'm

Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony
To tell me who I am! Who I was!
Uncertainty enveloping my mind
Till I can't break free and

Maybe it's a dream, maybe nothing else is real
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside
And I wish I could live feeling nothing but the night
You could tell me what to say, you could tell me where to go
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know
If I make another move, there'll be no more turning back
Because everything would change, and it all would fade to black

Will tomorrow ever come? Will I make it through the night?
Will there ever be a place for the broken in the light?
Am I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay or should I go?
I've forgotten how to tell, did I ever even know?
Can I take another step? I've done everything I can
All the people that I see, they will never understand
If I find a way to change, if I step into the light
Then I'll never be the same and it all will fade to white

Ever on and on, I continue circling
With nothing but my hate and the carousel of agony
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
And suddenly I see that I can't break free, I'm

Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony
To tell me who I am! Who I was!
Uncertainty enveloping my mind
Till I can't break free and

Maybe it's a dream, maybe nothing else is real
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside
And I wish I could live feeling nothing but the night
You could tell me what to say, you could tell me where to go
But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know
If I make another move, there'll be no more turning back
Because everything would change, and it all would fade to black

If I make another move, if I take another step
Then it all would fall apart
There'd be nothing of me left
If I'm crying in the wind, if I'm crying in the night
Will there ever be a way? Will my heart return to white?
Can you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I am?
I've forgotten how to see
I've forgotten if I can
If I opened up my eyes, there'd be no more going back
'Cause I'd throw it all away and it all would fade to black

Her carnal temptation
Took over my mind
Back then
Running from the fallout
Has turned my whole life
To mayhem

[Chorus]
I am the storm that is escaping
Evading
Parental obligations
I am the changer of my name
Life in flames
I am in debt
Just try and find me, you won't take a cent!
Forsakened child abandoned
A house and home I won't provide
Grow up in poverty
Without a father at your side

[Verse 2]
Inherit genetics
They're all that you're getting
'Cause I've run away
I'm keeping what's mine
You're wеlcome to whine
But I won't pay

I'm nevеr gonna pay the rent for
This kid whose mother I can't remember
A parent should be warm and tender
And I just can't be that kind of mentor

[Chorus]
I am the storm that is escaping
Evading
Parental obligations
I am the changer of my name
Off the grid
Hiding from debt
Just try and find me, you won't take a cent!
Forsakened child abandoned
A house and home I won't provide
Grow up in poverty
Without a father at your side
Disappeared into the night
No information left behind
Commitment repelling me
Sorry, I just don't have the time!

[Bridge]
Lurking in the shadows under veil of night
False identity staying out of sight
Dancing through my daily life with no paper trail
Detectives and P.I.'s have all tried and failed
A derelict that reeks of booze and cigarette ashes
Who's never registered to vote and never paid taxes
I only deal in cash, bury it when I make it
So if you want some alimony, come try and take it
You will not take
What I've earned
Secret trauma
Childhood yearned
My dad also
Never was there
Never admit
That I
Cared

[Instrumental Breakdown]

[Chorus 2]
Bury the guilt deep within!
Never still, there's no going home!
Scatter those feelings on the wind!
Because this cash is mine and mine alone!
